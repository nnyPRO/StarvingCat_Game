Created a game called Starving Cat using the main tool to code in VS Code. The game style is similar to Pacman; just change the characters. Instead of the yellow one, there will be a cat. Instead of the ghost chasing the yellow one, it will be a dog that chases cats. And instead of the yellow one eating the spots, the cat will eat fish. The rules for playing are different from Pacman in some parts. For example, if you hit a dog, you will die. There is no chance of being reborn.
